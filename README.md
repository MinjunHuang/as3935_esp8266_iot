Work was done with intention to protect electronic devices and so lower e-waste.
It might work or it may not, just don't sue me if your house burns down or if it kills you...
  
This software and hardware is described in my diploma thesis(work in progress). 
When it will be finished and published you can read it but just learn Slovenian first if you wish to read it:)
   
Use it for personal use as you will, just keep this notice on it if you do! 
And return changes back free of charge by same restrictions and notice! 
 
For comercial use you can contact me and we can make a deal...
 
Development took alot of time and money so remember me with some spare 
bitcoins: 1MaGphnuiMjywjQPKHKF239wzcef4KpNxX if you wish:)
  
This software uses expresif sdk software, spi library from David Ogilvy(MetalPhreak) and 
libesphttpd & wifi settins form Jeroen Domburg(sprite_fm), use and rescpect their respective licencies for their work.
